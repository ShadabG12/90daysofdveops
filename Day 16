🚢🐳 Day 16: Navigating the Docker Seas - A Dive into Docker and Its Commands! 🐳🚢

📝 In today's blog, we will be learning in detail about Docker - a technology that revolutionizes application development and deployment. 🌐

🐳 Docker, often likened to a lightweight shipyard for applications, empowers developers to encapsulate applications within isolated, portable containers.
These containers carry all the necessary ingredients for smooth sailing across various environments, ensuring consistent performance from ship to shore! 🌊

🔍 In this blog, we are diving into its core concepts and highlighting its significance in modern software development. We will reveal the magic behind Docker images, 
exploring how they're crafted from Docker files and provide a blueprint for your application's setup.

🚢 As we steer our ship, we will go deep into Docker commands. From launching containers to managing images, networks, and volumes, 
these commands are your trusty crewmates. 💼

💡 Here's a sneak peek at some of the Docker commands we cover:

docker pull: Load your ship with cargo (images) from the Docker registry.

docker run: Set sail by launching containers based on your chosen images.

docker ps and docker ps -a: Keep an eye on your fleet of containers.

docker build: Construct your Docker images from Docker files.
