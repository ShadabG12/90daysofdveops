Hello #Connections

I'm excited to share my progress on #Day25 of the #90daysofdevops challenge..

Day 25 Task: Complete Jenkins CI/CD Project - Continued with Documentation:

Task-01:
✅ Documented the entire process, starting from cloning the repository to configuring webhooks and executing deployments.
✅ Created a comprehensive README file that serves as a user-friendly guide.
✅ A well-written README not only helps others understand the project but also ensures I can use it efficiently in the future without any issues.
